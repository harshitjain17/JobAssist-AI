It is a good tool to utilize to possibly secure employment for an individual and can be \\nused after the completion of P ACE  if the job placement specialist believe s that a \\nconsumer needs additional training.  \\n2. The documents were updated recently to be more user -friendly.   \\n3. If a job placement specialist is  working with an employer and discussing utilizing OJT, \\nthe job placement specialist  would need to receive a written job description of the \\nposition.  \\n4.

The counselor will \\nmake the determination on how long the OJT will be written for at that time. (Th is will \\nvary per individual as some individuals may be able to execute the job in 1 month while \\nothers may need 2 months, etc.)  The maximum is six months  unless an extension above \\nthe six months is granted by the Job Placement Program Administrator.  \\n5.

The specifications of how \\noften the evaluation must be submitted by the employer will be liste d in the agreement.  \\nThe suggested time is at least one or two times a month  so that  the job placement \\nspecialist is  aware of what is going in at the worksite in case something needs to be \\naddressed.  \\n7. In regard to the wages, we can pay the minimum wage of $ 7.25.  If the employer usually \\npays the rate of $10/hour, they would be responsible for the remaining $2.75/per hour.  \\nThis differs from the PACE  Program, which has a  training stipend, and the employer is \\nnot responsible to hire or for any financial compen sation.  \\n8. In regard to insurance, the employer is responsible for covering them under workman\u2019s \\ncompensation as the agency does not cover consumers under liability as we do in P ACE . \\n9.

What happens during and after PACE?  \\nThe timesheet and the evaluation sheet should be reviewed weekly.

The job placement specialist sho uld stay in contact with \\nthe employer to  make sure things are going well and build a relationship for future PACE \\nplacements.  The job placement specialist can also take the time to talk with the employer about the \\nbenefits of working with OVR to find qual ified candidates for any future job openings.   \\nWith 20 hours or less remaining in PACE, the job placement specialist should call the consumer \\nand set up an appointment for job placement services unless directed to do otherwise or unless \\nPACE has shown tha t the consumer may need more supports in the workplace.
